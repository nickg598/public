Hello,
I think your listeners might be interested in a book and the story behind it, written by my wife, Corinne Dempsey, that recently came out in paperback.  It is based on a research project she did on Icelandic spiritualism.  She is a Religious Studies Professor at Nazareth College in Rochester, NY  (bio link: https://www2.naz.edu/index.php?cID=3085), a well respected scholar in her field, much published (4 books with Oxford Press, including this one), several edited volumes, many publications, winner of multiple awards and grants, an excellent teacher  and just plan awesome.  Yes, I'm biased and her biggest fan but all of the above is true.  

About the book in question,   I won't go into the entire story, but since it's publication Corinne has had many people comment to her on how helpful it, and her work on the topic, has been for them.   It is an important and fascinating subject that I think would be a great interest to the On Being community.  It is not a jargon laden academic book.  Because of the importance of the topic, she made it readily accessible to the general reader and wove her own journey into the discussion.  

The title is "Bridges between Worlds.  Spirits and Spirit Work in Northern Iceland"  (https://global.oup.com/academic/product/bridges-between-worlds-9780190625030?cc=us&lang=en&#).  

Her story about the project is described here:  https://www2.naz.edu/connections/fall-winter-2016/icelandic-uncanny/

If you are interested I will have a copy sent to you all. 

Thanks!
